## What to do:

- Before starting the test, create a repository in GitHub. Create your account if you don't have one yet. Do not commit anything yet.

- Create a file called my.log. When youâ€™re ready to begin coding, please push my.log file with a text "IN" in it as your initial commit and a commit message "IN". This will indicate your start time. And when you take a break push the my.log file with a text and a commit message "BREAK", "BACK" when you resume and "OUT" when you finish. Pushing development files excluding my.log file should be done the usual way.
